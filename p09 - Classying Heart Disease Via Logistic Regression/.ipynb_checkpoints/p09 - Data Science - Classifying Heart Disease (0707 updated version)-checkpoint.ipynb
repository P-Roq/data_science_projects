    "Welcome to the Guided Project for the **Logistic Regression Modeling in Python** course! We have learned a lot about logistic regression and classification in the past four lessons, and it's about time that we use this knowledge on a real-world dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the linear regression guided project, we'll also be looking at a real-life dataset: the [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset comes from the famous Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which recorded information on various patient characteristics, including age and chest pain, to try to classify the presence of **heart disease** in an individual. This a prime example of how machine learning can help solve problems that have a real impact on people's lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll practice going through the machine learning pipeline, starting from examining the dataset itself to creating a polished classification model. Classification problems are much more common than regression problems, so it'll be good to get some practice.\n",

    "    - Use the `read_csv()` function to read in the data and name the data `heart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we have partially cleaned the dataset so that we will perform binary classification. The original dataset has multiple classes, so you may download it from the site to attempt the guided project on multiple classes instead. For this guided project, we will focus on the binary classification case."

    "- `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved): in this case we can see a difference in the distributions: the second quartile starts around 145 beats per minute for 'not present', whereas the same quartile starts at a much lower number beats per minute - around 120. We include this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

To circumvent this problem we withdraw the variables with higher VIF and run again the auxiliary regressions; the new VIF results show that withdrawing those variables, in general, help to reduce the highest VIF values.

    "From both `scores_test_df` and `compare` (scores) tables, we can see that, in general, the accuracy decreased from the train set prediction around 5 to 6%. Sensitivity increased substantially for the model with all variables whilst roughly maintaining the same values for the other models. In terms of specificity, the best model is now the one without `age` and `thalach`, which saw the smallest reduction in that metric: -5.9%. In regards to the best model, no version has the best values all around. The model with all variables performs better in terms of sensitivity, which is arguably the most important metric, since the we are more interest in predicting cases (heart disease) than predicting non-cases (no heart disease). Conversely, the model chosen as reference - the model with no `age` and no `thalach`, performs substantially worst than the largest model by almost 10%, when comparing the test set sensitivity metric - 84.62 and 75%, respectively. Moreover, the former model actually performs much better than the latter model (all variables) in terms of specificity by a difference of 7.4%. \n",

    "Overall, these models seem to predict well the target's behavior and we can also attest that the predictions made via test set were high but inferior to those produced via train set, which indicates us that the model is not overfitting nor underfitting. In terms of how good these model are in predicting heart disease needs to be compared with other methodological approaches; regardless, every of the three prediction metrics used obtained values over 80%. The question of which model should be used as the reference is differed to an extended analysis on the original variables, in order to assess whether the numeric independent variables are linear (e.g. by checking the statistical significance of the interaction terms), and also to try to detect and remove influential outliers that weren't spotted (e.g. resorting to cook's distance). Fitting and computing predictions using another data set with the same variables, or turning the train set into the test set, and vice-versa, could also shed some light on the robustness of their prediction power.\n",

The logistic regression model is our second classification model that we've encountered, but we also saw elements of linear regression here. Binary classification opens the door to multi-class classification, such as the famous MNIST dataset. All of the models we've learned so far are simple but fundamental to understanding more complex models.\n",
